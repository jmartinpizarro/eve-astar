<br>
EVE Online is commonly known for having a massive size for travelling across solar systems... In fact, it has over 7500 different systems. That is a big number, specially **if you want to travel from a point A to a point B**.

<br>
EVE-astar is a personal project for deepning into heuristics and search algorithm.

<br>
Made in C++ for optimization, it has been implemented from zero to hero.


## Use-Cases
1. Given the map of a region/constellation, the origin point (A) and the destination point (B), you want to **travel using the shortest _high security_ route possible**.
2. Given the map of a region/constellation, the origin point (A) and the destination point (B), you want to **travel using the shortest route possible**.
3. Given the map of a region/constellation, the origin point (A) and the destination point (B), you want to **travel using the just a low/null security route**.

Please, enjoy this as much as I have (probably not, it is going to be a nightmare) coding it.
